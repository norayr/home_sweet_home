#    Option	"DontZoom"

# Uncomment this to disable tuning with the xvidtune client. With

# receive a protocol error.

#    Option	"DisableVidModeExtension"

# Uncomment this to enable the use of a non-local xvidtune client.

# change the keyboard or mouse settings (currently only xset).

# Set the basic blanking screen saver timeout in minutes.  0 to disable.

# Set the DPMS timeouts.  These are set here because they are global
# rather than screen-specific.  These settings alone don't enable DPMS.
# It is enabled per-screen (or per-monitor), and even then only when

# VirtualDesktop indicates which virtual desktop should be used by X,
